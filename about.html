            <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
              The Mediterranean Project was founded by a fond traveller; Naomi,
              who has a deep passion for exploring diverse cultures, traditions,
              and world history. With a particular love for the Mediterranean
              region. After travelling around a large portion of the world,
              Naomi realised how much the region had a universal pull and how
              special it really was. It's culturally and historically rich
              region has some of the tastiest and healthiest cuisines in the
              world coupled with some of the most stunning landscapes and
              landmarks as old as time.
